# Hi, I'm Jayesh 👋

🎮 **Game Programmer**  
I'm passionate about building interactive worlds and playful experiences. My journey started with Unity, where I've crafted games and prototypes, and now I'm diving deep into OpenGL and C++ to understand the fundamentals of graphics and real-time rendering.

## 🚀 What I Do
- **Game Programming**: Designing and developing gameplay, mechanics, and systems.
- **Unity**: Proficient with C# and Unity for 2D & 3D game development.

## 🌟 Featured Project

[Virtual Pets 🐾](https://github.com/Jayesh-27/Virtual-Pets)  
A desktop pet simulation built from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. This project challenged and grew my understanding of graphics programming.

## 🕹️ Fun Facts
- I love both playing and making games!
- Always learning something new about game engines, rendering, and interactive storytelling.
